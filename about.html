                    <p>REBELLE is a Los Angeles-based disco/dance-pop artist, powerhouse vocalist, songwriter, and classically trained singer whose shimmering, high-energy sound blends retro flair with fearless modern pop. With a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance freshly earned, she's quickly carving out her place in the LA music scene — known for her bold, emotionally charged lyrics, glam-pop aesthetic, and electrifying performances.</p>
                    
                    <p>Writing all of her own material, Rebelle draws sonic inspiration from icons like Britney Spears, ABBA, and Katy Perry, delivering empowering anthems built for the dance floor. Her singles Break Me, Eternity, and Taboo have received international airplay and led to performances at top venues including Avalon Hollywood, Hotel Ziggy, Dreamland at Aviator Nation, WFNM at Bar Lubitsch, LA City Hall, and more. She recently headlined her first international mini-tour with shows in Vienna, Croatia, and Los Angeles to celebrate the release of Taboo.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rebelle is an active voice on LA's live circuit — performing as a solo artist, as a lead vocalist in a tribute band, and as a sought-after session singer. She also teaches voice and is passionate about helping others develop their artistry and technique. Her writing credits include original music for short films, jingles for Croatia's national Radio 1, and collaborations with respected artists including Dennis Quaid, Carmine Rojas (David Bowie), Phil Lo Presti, Eric Ekstrand, Oliver Lopez Diaz, Logan Ledger, and more.</p>
                    
                    <p>She's a proud three-time mentee of the Recording Academy's Grammy U program, having been mentored by Amira Gadd, a renowned music supervisor and sync expert, Matthew Puckett, an award-winning composer and producer, and Grammy-nominated producer Sam Pikar. In 2023, she was named fan-favorite winner at Music Forward's Open Mic and performed background vocals for Dennis Quaid at the 31st Annual Movieguide Awards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Originally from Croatia, Rebelle's career began early — as a finalist on Croatia's Got Talent at age 10 and later as the lead villain in the country's first musical, Music of My Heart. She also performed at the prestigious Lisinski Hall before relocating to the U.S. to pursue music full-time.</p>
                    
                    <p>With her debut album in the works, Rebelle is building an unapologetic pop universe — one glittering, defiant anthem at a time.</p>
